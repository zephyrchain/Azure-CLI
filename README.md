# Azure Palo Alto VM-Series Deployment Script

## Overview

This repository provides an Azure CLI-based deployment solution for Palo Alto VM-Series firewalls in a production-grade environment within the **East US** region. It automates the provisioning of networking components, virtual machines, and VPN connectivity to ensure a secure and scalable infrastructure.

> ‚úÖ Use this script to streamline firewall deployment, enforce network segmentation, and establish secure site-to-site VPN connectivity.

---

## Why Use This Script?

This deployment script helps you:

- Rapidly deploy Palo Alto VM-Series firewalls with best-practice configurations
- Automate resource provisioning for consistent and repeatable deployments
- Integrate VPN and BGP routing for hybrid connectivity
- Enhance security posture with NSGs and custom routing

---

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure the following:

| Requirement | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Azure Subscription | Must be active and have resource creation permissions |
| Azure CLI | Installed and authenticated (`az login`) |
| SSH Key Pair | Required for VM access (`ssh-keygen` if not already generated) |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Replace the placeholder subscription ID (`Add Subscription ID Here`) with your actual Azure Subscription ID in NIC creation commands.

  - Three NICs assigned to respective subnets

- **Network Security**
  - NSG with rules for SSH and HTTPS
  - NSG associated with management NIC

### VM-Series Deployment

- Accepts legal terms for Palo Alto image
- Deploys VM with:
  - Palo Alto image `bundle2:8.1.0`
  - Three NICs

### VPN Gateway Setup

- Local network gateway and public IPs
- Virtual network gateway with BGP
- Site-to-site VPN connection

### Routing Configuration

- Route table with next-hop to firewall
- Route table associated with gateway subnet
